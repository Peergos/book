# Public Key Infrastructure

All users have a public identity key, and these are stored in a merkle-champ. This structure is mirrored by all nodes (or you can delegate to a mirror you trust). This includes the user's claim to a username along with an expiry, and their current storage server's public key. The effect is similar to certificate or key transparency logs. In contrast though, key transparency logs are not normally used as the source of truth, but only checked retrospectively, occasionally for some users. So this gives much stronger guarantees whilst maintaining the append-only nature. Mirrors reject updates that are not append-only, so the pki cannot tamper with the mappings.

This allows users to do public key lookups without leaking to the network who they are looking up. Users also store the keys of their friends in their own filesystem in a TOFU setup, which also rejects invalid updates. This means that ordinary usage doesn't involve looking up keys from the public pki servers.
