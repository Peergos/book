# Merkle-CHAMP

The main network visible data structure in Peergos is a merkle compressed hash array mapped trie, or merkle-champ. This data structure is explained in the next section. All the data under a given writing keypair has its own merkle-champ. This is just a mapping from random 32 byte labels to cipher-text blobs. These blobs are [cryptree](/security/cryptree.html) nodes containing the cryptree data structure, and, in the case of a file section, up to 5 merkle links to encrypted file fragments (Max 1 MiB each). A merkle-link is just a hash that references another ipfs object. Each 5 MiB section of a file is stored under a different random label in the champ, and similarly with large directories.
