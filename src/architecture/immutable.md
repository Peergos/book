# Immutable

The immutable data store is provided by IPFS and allows anyone to retrive any cipher text from its hash through any Peergos node. Note that IPFS is used in a fully trustless manner. Every single hash and signature is checked client side during reads and writes. The underlyign storage can be provided by the local harddisk or any cloud provider without loss of privacy.
