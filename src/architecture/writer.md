# Writing subspaces

Each user has a randomly generated writing key pair which controls writes to their filesystem. They can create new writing key pairs for any subtree, for example when granting write access to a file or folder. If desired, a given writing key can be quota controlled, to prevent users to which you've granted write access to a file from filling your data store.
