# Merkle-btree

The main netork visible data structure in Peergos is a merkle-btree. All the data under a given writing keypair has its own merkle-btree. This is just a mapping from random 32 byte labels to cipher-text blobs. These blobs are cryptree nodes containing the cryptree data structure, and, in the case of a file section, merkle links to encrypted file fragments. Each 5 MiB section of a file is stored under a different random label in the btree, and similarly with large directories.
