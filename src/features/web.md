# Web interface

In keeping with our aim to be as convenient to use as existing centralised services, Peergos has a web interface which can be used instead of a native application. This interface does not require any special knowledge, especially not of cryptography or keys, but should none-the-less encourage/enforce safe practices. The web interface does not load any code from third-party servers and is entirely self hosted.

The web interface can be accessed from a public server over https or from your machine if you run Peergos locally.
