Peergos has an in-band mechanism for sharing files/send messages to other users. There is a one-way following mechanism. If Agata follows Bartek then Bartek can share files with Agata. If Bartek is also following Agata, then she can also share files with Bartek. Following can be revoked by either user at any point.

There is also a public link mechanism for sharing files with people who do not have peergos accounts.
