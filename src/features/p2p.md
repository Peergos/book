# Peer-to-peer

Peergos is built with a peer-to-peer architecture to protect against censorship and surveillance and to improve resiliency. There is no central surveillance point that an attacker could monitor all file transfers through. There is also no central dns name or TLS certificate authority that could be used to attack the network.
