# Migration

Your identity in Peergos is not tied to any particular server. Compared to other federated social networks where moving server typically involves losing your social network and meta-data, if not data too, Peergos allows you to transparently migrate between servers and storage providers without any action required from your friends and without any data loss.

This means, for example, you could start out by creating an account on our demo server which gives you a small amount of storage, then effortlessly migrate to a paid server, or to your own server when you realise how awesome Peergos is.
