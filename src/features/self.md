# Self hosting

Peergos is fully self hostable. You can run peergos from your own home or server to obtain as much storage and bandwidth as you need, whilst still transparently interacting with anyone using any other server. Because the server only ever sees encrypted data you can also tell it to directly store your data in a standard cloud storage provider like Backblaze or Amazon without any loss of privacy.
