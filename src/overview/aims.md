# Aims

 - To allow individuals to securely and privately store files in a peer to peer network which has no central node and is generally difficult to disrupt or surveil
 - To allow secure sharing of such files with other users of the network without visible meta-data (who shares with who)
 - To have a beautiful user interface that any computer or mobile user can understand
 - To enable a new secure form of email, with optional interop with actual email
 - To be independent of the central SSL CA trust architecture, and the domain name system
 - Self hostable - A user should be able to easily run Peergos on a machine in their home and get their own Peergos storage space, and social communication platform from it 
 - A secure web interface as well as desktop clients, and native folder sync
 - Enable users to collaborate, editing a document in place concurrently
 - To enable secure real time chat, and eventually realtime video chat
 - Plausibly deniable dual login to an account, ala Truecrypt
 - Optional use of U2F for securing login
