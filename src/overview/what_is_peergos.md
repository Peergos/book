# What is Peergos

You can think of Peergos as a cross between Dropbox, email, Facebook, Youtube and Twitter, but fully end-to-end encrypted and decentralised to keep your data and social graph private.

Peergos is a peer-to-peer encrypted filesystem with secure sharing of files designed to be resistant to surveillance of data content or friendship graphs. It will have a secure email replacement, with some interoperability with email. There will also be a totally private and secure social network, where users are in control of who sees what (executed cryptographically).

The name Peergos comes from the Greek word Πύργος (Pyrgos), which means stronghold or tower, but phonetically spelt with the nice connection to being peer-to-peer. It is pronounced peer-goss, as in gossip. 

**WARNING:** Peergos is still alpha software, and needs an independent security audit. Don't use it for data you can't afford to lose or expose, yet. Some of the features in this documentation are yet to be imlemented, in particular, Tor is not used yet.
